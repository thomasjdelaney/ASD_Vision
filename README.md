# Links.md

In this file, you will find some useful links. Like the link to the pyNN documentation.

# Papers

In this directory, you will find pdf files for papers useful for this project. There is also a 'References.md' file giving a citation for each one of the papers, sorted in alphabetical order by the surname of the first author.

# Presentations

This directory contains LibreOffice presentations for individual meetings with Yukie. The 'ircn_research_plan.odp' is the earliest meeting, chronologically. Each of the presentations should give an idea of what I researched during the two weeks before the day of the meeting.

# SNN\_binary_classification

For practising with spiking neural networks. Mostly using pyNN. You will find a separate README.md file in this directory for more detail.
